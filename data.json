This peninsula has no roads, no cars, and Tonsai Beach (the beach next to Railay where we were staying) has practically no people. Just one \"Chill Out Bar\" with a fire dancing show and Jenga. Quite the combo. In our time here we packed in plenty of beach time, a full day of climbing, paddleboarding at (and after) sunset, and unexpectedly meeting monkeys on our jungle trek from Tonsai to Railay one afternoon.",

So if we're here, why not check out what makes this place so famous. While we weren't originally planning on diving at the start of our trip, I'm so glad we decided on getting scuba certified here. And if scuba's not your thing, there are plenty of other activities too - snorkeling, walking around the island (no cars, just bikes and horse-drawn buggies), catching live music on the main stretch (while watching the night divers crawl out of the water out of nowhere like aliens.)

What an adventure: picked up at our hotel at 2am, fried bananas at 3am, hiking from 3:30-5:30am, sunrise, walking the crater rim (surrounded by more monkeys of course), and jogging down.

We were thrilled when 40-minutes into our 50-minute dive, we saw a huge manta ray float right past us like an eagle!

Even though our vacation featured quite a bit of monkeys already, we still couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out Ubud's famous Monkey Forest. Over 600 monkeys roaming free beside you, is not something you'll find in many other places in the world. The monkeys really seemed to like Rachel's backpack (and the Cliff bar wrappers in the side pocket), and... my head. Maybe the blonde hair is similar to a banana? That's my logic at least. The next day, we checked out the small-family owned Tegalalong Rice Terrace, a coffee and spice plantation, and spring water temple, Tirta Empel. ",
