We stopped here for an extended layover of 2 nights to explore the city. Which made us truly realize that we are not quite city people. But even a city holds treasure for those who don't find themselves at home in cities - we started our one full day at Batu Caves (biggest cave I've ever seen, complete with monkeys and a temple), followed by a lot of walking, escaping the heat a bit for lunch and ice cream at malls (now we know why it's called MALaysia), and a fountain light show at sundown near the famous Petronas Towers.",y6/4/18,CBF3F0,Lombok,"The Gilis - tiny islands off the coast of Lombok, Indonesia (not-as-tiny island next to Bali) - are known as one of the best scuba spots in the world.
